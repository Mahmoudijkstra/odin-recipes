        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish made with long, thin noodles that are boiled to a perfect al dente texture and often served with a rich and flavorful sauce. The most popular variation, spaghetti with marinara, features a tomato-based sauce simmered with garlic, onions, and aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. Ground meats, such as beef or pork, are often added to create a hearty Bolognese, while simple additions like olive oil, fresh parsley, and parmesan cheese make for a lighter dish.</p>
        <p>Spaghetti can be paired with a variety of toppings and ingredients to suit different tastes. Meatballs, seafood, or roasted vegetables can transform the dish into a gourmet meal. Typically garnished with freshly grated parmesan and a sprinkle of black pepper, it is a versatile recipe that balances texture and flavor. Served with a side of garlic bread or a crisp green salad, spaghetti is a beloved comfort food enjoyed worldwide.</p>
