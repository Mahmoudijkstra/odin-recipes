    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Rice is a versatile and staple grain enjoyed by cultures worldwide,
      serving as a foundation for countless dishes. It comes in various types,
      including long-grain, short-grain, basmati, jasmine, and arborio, each
      offering a unique texture and flavor. White rice is polished for a smooth,
      mild taste, while brown rice retains its bran layer, providing a nutty
      flavor and higher nutritional value. Its neutral flavor makes it the
      perfect accompaniment to a variety of dishes, from savory curries and
      stir-fries to sweet puddings and desserts.

      Cooking rice is simple yet customizable, with methods like boiling,
      steaming, or using a rice cooker to achieve the desired
      consistencyâ€”whether light and fluffy or rich and creamy. Its adaptability
      allows it to take center stage in dishes like risotto, biryani, or fried
      rice while complementing proteins and vegetables as a side. Rich in
      carbohydrates and naturally gluten-free, rice is a nourishing and
      satisfying ingredient that continues to be a culinary cornerstone across
      the globe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Butter or oil</li>
      <li>Aromatics</li>
      <li>Herbs and spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer or a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes
        excess starch and prevents clumping.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, water, and salt (if
        using).
      </li>
      <li>Add butter or oil for extra flavor, if desired.</li>
      <li>Place the saucepan on the stovetop over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Bring the water to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice
        from sticking to the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>Once the water boils, reduce the heat to low.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let it simmer gently.</li>
      <li>White rice: Cook for 15-18 minutes.</li>
      <li>Brown rice: Cook for 40-45 minutes.</li>
      <li>After the cooking time, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
      <li>
        Keep the lid on and let the rice rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the
        rice to finish steaming and absorb any remaining liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot as a side dish or base for your favorite recipe.</li>
    </ol>
