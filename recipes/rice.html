        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Rice is a versatile and staple grain enjoyed by cultures worldwide, serving as a foundation for countless dishes. It comes in various types, including long-grain, short-grain, basmati, jasmine, and arborio, each offering a unique texture and flavor. White rice is polished for a smooth, mild taste, while brown rice retains its bran layer, providing a nutty flavor and higher nutritional value. Its neutral flavor makes it the perfect accompaniment to a variety of dishes, from savory curries and stir-fries to sweet puddings and desserts.</p>
        <p>Cooking rice is simple yet customizable, with methods like boiling, steaming, or using a rice cooker to achieve the desired consistencyâ€”whether light and fluffy or rich and creamy. Its adaptability allows it to take center stage in dishes like risotto, biryani, or fried rice while complementing proteins and vegetables as a side. Rich in carbohydrates and naturally gluten-free, rice is a nourishing and satisfying ingredient that continues to be a culinary cornerstone across the globe.</p>
